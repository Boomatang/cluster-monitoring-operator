== DedicatedServiceMonitors

=== Description

Configuration for prometheus-adapter dedicated Service Monitors. When Enabled is set to true, CMO will deploy and scrape a dedicated Service Monitor, that exposes the kubelet /metrics/resource endpoint. This Service Monitor sets honorTimestamps: true and only keeps metrics that are relevant for the pod resource queries of prometheus-adapter. Additionally prometheus-adapter is configured to use these dedicated metrics. Overall this will improve the consistency of prometheus-adapter based CPU usage measurements used by for example the oc adm top pod command or the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
